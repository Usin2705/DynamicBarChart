A simple Dynamic chart, representing my effort of switching from Excel presentation to Python.

Excel chart is a lot easier and faster to set up, but you can't control how the chart look as much as Python, and you also don't have buttons work as good as Python's widgets (you can still add Buttons, Sliders... in Excel, but it's slower and won't give you full control).


I'm using matplotlib widgets here. It take a few days to understand how they work, and how to set them up properly. The result is acceptable, still not work 100% as how I want it to work. However, like I said, you have full control over it, so you can improve it as much as you want.


I'm put this one up here as a template so I can reuse it later with other data as well.


This example include the list of "disrupted" stocks. The list is a drafted version, and until this day has changed a lot.
